The dataset contains images of signed letters in the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. This dataset consists of 24 classes, one for each letter excluding "J" and "Z". The images portray different speakers with different fluency levels and contain various backgrounds. Some images show the speaker's left hand.

The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can classify the images in the test set with an accuracy of at least 90%. 

The images have already been labeled and split into training and test sets in the folder.

Part 1: Investigate and Prepare Your Data

For this project, specify 80% of the images in the "Train" folder for training and the remaining 20% for validation. resize the images to perform transfer learning.

Part 2: Train and Evaluate a Classifier

You must train a model that classifies the test data with at least 90% accuracy.
You may want to visualize your results to understand better how your model is performing.
It may take several attempts with different training options to achieve the required test accuracy.
